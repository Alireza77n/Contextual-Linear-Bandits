Probabilistic reinforcement learning is a powerful approach for
modeling the distribution of arms in recommender systems. In this
paper, we explore two methods for optimizing advertisement display
to maximize cumulative rewards. The first method involves online logistic regression to identify parameters that maximize the probability
of a click for each ad displayed. The second method utilizes Thompson Sampling with Laplace approximation to learn the distribution of
arms and select the ads most likely to receive clicks. We implement
these algorithms on simulated data and compare their performance.
